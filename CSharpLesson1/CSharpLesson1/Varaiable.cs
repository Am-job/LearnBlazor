/*
->Variables 

Variables are containers for storing data values.
In C#, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
bool - stores values with two states: true or false

//type variableName = value;
//string name = "John";
//Console.WriteLine(name);

//Constant
//const int myNum = 15;
//myNum = 20; // error

//Multiple Variables
//int x = 5, y = 6, z = 50;
//Console.WriteLine(x + y + z);

//Identifier
/*
The general rules for naming variables are:
Names can contain letters, digits and the underscore character (_)
Names must begin with a letter
Names should start with a lowercase letter and it cannot contain whitespace
Names are case sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
Reserved words(like C# keywords, such as int or double) cannot be used as names
